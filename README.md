# PartyBear's Miscellaneous V2.0

**PartyBear's Miscellaneous** is a web platform that blends the passion for **football** with the digital culture of modern **brainrots**.  
Here you’ll find real-time match results, data-based predictions, and the most viral football-related content.

## Project Description

This project aims to combine **sports analytics, prediction modeling, and entertainment** in one place.  
Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, the website is fully responsive and adaptable to any device.

The main sections include:
 
- **Predictions:** smart and interactive football match outcome predictions.  
- **Brainrots:** the funniest and trendiest memes.  
- **Landing Page:** a quick introduction to what the project offers.
- **Matches:** A list of the matches saved on LocalStorage (read).
- **Manage Matches:** Modify, delete, create your current matches stored on LocalStorage.

## What did I base this project on?

This project was based on the following template:

- [Dribble - Genie Personal AI Assistant](https://dribbble.com/shots/25109551-Genie-Chatbot-Personal-AI-Assistant)

This is because I used the same structure on the landing page (using left and right containters).
